# Waila for Better Than Wolves CE 3.x

* Waila (What Am I Looking At) is a UI improvement mod aimed at providing block information directly ingame, without the need of opening an UI.
* It provides a small unobtrusive tooltip on top of the screen with informations about the block the player is looking at.
* A powerful API is provided so other modders can add their own information relative to their blocks to it.
* Added animations and break progress line
* Depended Forge Config addon (https://github.com/ysesiq/ForgeConfig-BTW/releases)
